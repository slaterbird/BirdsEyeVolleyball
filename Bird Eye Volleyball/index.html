            <h3>About Bird's Eye</h3>
            <p>
                Slater Bird is a versatile volleyball athlete and coach, raised in Rancho Peñasquitos, San Diego, in a family deeply rooted in the sport. With parents who both played at SDSU, an uncle who competed at CSUN, a brother who played at BYU, and a sister who played at the University of Miami, volleyball has been an integral part of his life. Slater’s athletic career includes over five years of competitive collegiate experience, notably playing for UCSB and competing in England’s professional league while representing the University of Nottingham. His time in England broadened his understanding of the global game, strengthening his skills and adapting to high-level competition. Slater has immersed himself in all facets of the sport, excelling in indoor, beach, and grass volleyball. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Having grown up playing for Seaside Volleyball Club, Slater was inspired by its core philosophy: teaching life lessons through volleyball. This philosophy remains a guiding principle in his coaching as he strives to influence youth, helping them develop both on and off the court. Trained under the principles of Gold Medal Squared Volleyball, Slater has honed his methods to inspire players of all levels. Now, he runs skill-focused clinics and tournaments across the country, bringing his elite training, professional experience, and lifelong passion to the volleyball community.
