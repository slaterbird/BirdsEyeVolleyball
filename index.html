            <h3>About Bird's Eye</h3>
            <p>
                Slater Bird is a passionate volleyball athlete and coach, raised in Rancho Peñasquitos, San Diego, where volleyball became a central part of his life. Growing up in a family with deep roots in the sport—his parents played at SDSU, his uncle competed at CSUN, his brother at BYU, and his sister at the University of Miami—he was surrounded by inspiration and support. These influences helped shape his journey and foster his love for the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Slater’s athletic career spans over five years of collegiate competition, including playing for UCSB and representing the University of Nottingham in England’s professional league. His time abroad not only expanded his understanding of the game but also pushed him to adapt and grow at a higher level of competition. Over the years, he has immersed himself in every aspect of the sport, gaining valuable experience in indoor, beach, and grass volleyball.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a product of Seaside Volleyball Club, Slater was deeply influenced by its philosophy of using volleyball to teach life lessons. This approach continues to guide his work today, as he aims to inspire and support youth both on and off the court. Trained in the principles of Gold Medal Squared Volleyball, Slater focuses on creating meaningful coaching experiences that encourage players to grow as athletes and individuals. Through clinics and tournaments across the country, he is excited to share his lifelong passion for volleyball and help others discover their potential.
